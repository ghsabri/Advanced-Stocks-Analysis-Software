## 🎯 KEY FEATURES EXPLAINED

### TR Indicator (Our Proprietary System)

**What it is:**  
A 6-stage classification system that identifies where a stock is in its market cycle, from Strong Buy to Strong Sell.

**The 6 Stages:**
- **Stage 1:** Basing/Accumulation (Neutral) - Stock building foundation
- **Stage 2:** Advancing (Buy) - Confirmed uptrend
- **Stage 2+:** Strong Advance (Strong Buy) ⭐ **BEST** - Powerful uptrend
- **Stage 3:** Topping/Distribution (Neutral) - Uptrend losing momentum
- **Stage 4:** Declining (Sell) - Confirmed downtrend
- **Stage 4+:** Strong Decline (Strong Sell) - Steep downtrend

**How to use it:**  
Focus on Stage 2 and Stage 2+ stocks for long positions. These represent stocks in confirmed uptrends with strong momentum.

**Color coding:**
- 🟢 **Green** = Bullish signals (Stage 2, 2+)
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Neutral (Stage 1, 3)
- 🔴 **Red** = Bearish signals (Stage 4, 4+)

---

### AI Confidence Scores

**What it is:**  
Machine learning models predict the success probability of detected chart patterns based on historical data.

**Confidence Levels:**
- **90-100%:** Very High (rare, strongest setups)
- **75-89%:** High (good probability of success)
- **60-74%:** Moderate (decent probability)
- **Below 60%:** Low (use caution)

**How to use it:**  
Combine with TR Indicator for best results. A Stage 2+ stock with an 80%+ confidence pattern is a high-probability trading setup.

**Model Accuracy:**
- Daily timeframe: **91.5% accuracy** (Ichimoku Cloud strategy)
- Weekly timeframe: **81.8% accuracy** (Ichimoku Cloud strategy)

---

### Pattern Detection

**What we detect automatically:**

**Reversal Patterns:**
- Head & Shoulders (bearish reversal)
- Inverse Head & Shoulders (bullish reversal)
- Double Top (bearish reversal)
- Double Bottom (bullish reversal)

**Continuation Patterns:**
- Bull Flag (bullish continuation)
- Bear Flag (bearish continuation)
- Cup and Handle (bullish continuation)

**Breakout Patterns:**
- Ascending Triangle (typically bullish)
- Descending Triangle (typically bearish)
- Symmetrical Triangle (direction TBD)

**What you'll see for each pattern:**
- Pattern type and AI confidence score
- Entry price (where to enter the trade)
- Target price (profit objective)
- Stop loss (risk management level)
- Risk/reward ratio
- Timeframe for expected move

---

### Watchlists Feature

**Purpose:**  
Analyze multiple stocks efficiently instead of one-by-one.

**Key Features:**
- Create unlimited watchlists (organize by strategy, sector, timeframe)
- Custom views (choose which columns to display)
- Bulk analysis (analyze all stocks at once)
- Sort and filter results by any metric
- Save and reload anytime

**Pro Tips for Watchlists:**

Create different watchlists for different strategies:
- **"Long-term Growth"** - Stage 2+ stocks only
- **"Swing Trades"** - Stage 2 with high-confidence patterns
- **"Day Trading"** - High volatility stocks with tight stops
- **"Earnings Plays"** - Stocks with upcoming catalysts

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis

**Three timeframes available:**
- **Daily** - Short-term trading (days to weeks)
- **Weekly** - Swing trading (weeks to months)
- **Monthly** - Position trading (months to years)

**Best Practice:**  
Check multiple timeframes for stronger confirmation. When daily, weekly, AND monthly all show Stage 2+, that's a very powerful signal indicating alignment across all time horizons.

**How to switch:**  
Use the dropdown menu in the analysis section to toggle between Daily/Weekly/Monthly views.
